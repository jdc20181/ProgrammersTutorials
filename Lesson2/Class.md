#Part 2 Introduction.  

The second part of learning CSS is adapting it to HTML, whether its new, or existing. 

Take a look at the `Demos` folder in this lesson. 

#Classes

We are going to go over the basics of a class, in the introduction we went over how to set up a class, but now you also need to know how to 
format a class and give it properties. 

*Introduction to JSfiddle*

Over the short period of understanding this course you will get to use a Sandbox where you can explore code. I use *JSFiddle*  or *Codepen*
But for beginners, its better to use *JSFiddle* as the layout is much simpler. 

In some assignments you will need to make a fiddle. Usually it will include a special text or something alike, and unique, to make sure its yours. 
While this course is just for personal learning you want to make sure to complete the material in the course. 

Head on over to [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/) and create your first fiddle. Name it `Hello-World` - when you first arive at the website you may 
have to make an account, I use it regularly so, if it is, I appologize. Its free, and easy. 

In a Coding Sandbox, you don't need to put anything in the heading area, or have the `<html>` opening tags. It is programmed to do this automatically for us. 
So, to complete this first task, I randomly put up a fiddle with some random properties for you to explore. You can use your Fiddle, don't forget to name it!
And discover other properties. 

A good resource is w3schools, while some material isn't the best in some instances, for the most part it is pretty good. 

A quick shoutout to them for helping create some of the material in this course, some of it is based off the w3.css framework. 

More will be added to this course soon.
