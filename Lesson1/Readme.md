#Welcome!

As a student, you will learn the basics of :

 - HTML5 
 
 - CSS3
 
 - Javascript
 
 With these you should be able to :
 
  - Build Webpages
  
  - Build Web-Apps 
  
#Course Structure

The structure of the course will be broken into `Lesson` Folders. Each Lesson is considered a Unit of the course. Really there 
is 3 units. `HTML` `CSS` and `Javascript` however, there is the advanced study, which you will create larger projects based on the course. 

Right now there is:

- A Calculator 

- A Web App

- A Business Website

These will exercise a small piece of what you learned. Most of these were part of the examples in each unit. 

A Final Unit, will be the final exam and will help you understand how to use HTML, CSS , and Javascript which is to build yourself a portfolio site.  



#Lesson 1 : HTML 

In this lesson we will answer the following questions:

 - *What is HTML ?* 
 
- *What is it used for?*

- *Why is it important?*

#Introduction

*HTML* Stands for *Hyper Text Markup Language* it has been around for a while, and has impacted the way we use modern computers, and now days, Tablets, and Smart phones. But, let's look past the name, what **Really** is HTML?

HTML makes up every single website on the web - and a lot of apps rely on it as well! 

I am not here to really say the history of HTML but, it is important, simply because without it, websites couldn't be. 

#Getting Down to the Basics. 

We are only going to be covering a few tags, reason being, is you should be new, and when you was just starting to read, they didn't make you read a 500 page book did they ? Hope not, so I don't plan on telling you every tag and its function. 

You may want to write these down, they are very helpful!

*`<head>` Head Tag*

The Head tag is at the top of a HTML document and is where we link our CSS. 

*`<H1>` Heading Tags *

Heading Tags come in (3) main sizes, H1, H2 , and H3. They are very important for titles on pages, or titles on blog posts, think of a newspaper, it has "Headlines" well, this tag makes a headline or title of a page standout. 

*`<p>` Paragraph Tag*

The Paragraph tag starts a new paragraph, essentially skipping a few lines. That way if you are writing big articles it is well organized. 

*`<div>` Division Tag*

Outside of a special purpose it will be executed as a paragraph, the Division tag is important for those who want to make a "Classic" webpage with sidebars footers etc. 

*`<body>` Tag*

The Body tag is the body of your text, you have a basic layout of a webpage, Title, Body, Footer. 

#Take a look at the other documents in this lesson. 

The other documents in this lesson will help you better understand HTML. It is reccomended to use something like codepen.io or Cloud9 to experiment with code presented throughout the course.
