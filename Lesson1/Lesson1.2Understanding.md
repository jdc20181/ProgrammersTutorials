Next - Explore the different *Elements* on the page. 

  - `<html>`
  - `<div`
  - `<p>`
  - `<body>`
  - `<head>`
  
As you can tell like many sites, these are important to developing websites, and apps. Especially if they involve using `HTML`

Exploring the Browser Inspection Feature - Mobile Toggle. 

**Exercise 2 Mobile Exploration **

*Part 1*

On the same site, in Google Chrome, you can toggle to see what a website looks like on mobile devices, later on we will discuss the importance of mobile compatibility or making a entire different version for mobile users. 

Take note that on [http://example.com](http://example.com) no matter the screen size, *Or* device it is responsive. 

*Part 2*

Exploring the rest of the Inspection interface is important for the rest of the course, be sure to take notes. 

Now, explore the rest of the options in this interface or click the "x" to go back to the regular site, refreshing will also close the interface.
