#Background

Be sure you read through the Readme, as this explains the elements, I won't be explaining what they are but, what they are used for. 

In the previous Sub-Lesson we went over the importance, and very well known elements. 

Now, you need to know what elements to use - when to, and not to use them. 

Headings should be done at the `Top` of the page. **before** the main body text. 

A simple error made is, getting the element `<h>` tags mixed up. '<h1>` actually is the largest and `<h6>` is the smallest. 

Generally, `<h6>` is used for sub headings, sometimes you can use larger, depending on what you are developing. 

It is important to understand this, because when you go to make a professional website, making wrong moves, could result in you looking bad.
